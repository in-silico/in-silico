Problem</A></FONT></H2>
<P>Have you ever played Minesweeper? It's a cute little game which comes =
within=20
a certain Operating System which name we can't really remember. Well, =
the goal=20
of the game is to find where are all the mines within a MxN field. To =
help you,=20
the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there =
are=20
adjacent to that square. For instance, supose the following 4x4 field =
with 2=20
mines (which are represented by an * character): <PRE>*...
....
.*..
....
</PRE>If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers =
described=20
above, we would end up with: <PRE>*100
2210
1*10
1110
</PRE>As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 =
adjacent=20
squares. </U></U>
<H2><FONT color=3D#0070e8><A name=3DSECTION0001003000000000000000>The=20
Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first =
line of=20
each field contains two integers n and m (0 &lt; n,m &lt;=3D 100) which =
stands for=20
the number of lines and columns of the field respectively. The next n =
lines=20
contains exactly m characters and represent the field. Each safe square =
is=20
represented by an "." character (without the quotes) and each mine =
square is=20
represented by an "*" character (also without the quotes). The first =
field line=20
where n =3D m =3D 0 represents the end of input and should not be =
processed.=20
<H2><FONT color=3D#0070e8><A name=3DSECTION0001004000000000000000>The=20
Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>For each field, you must print the following message in a line alone: =
<PRE>Field #x:</PRE>Where x stands for the number of the field (starting =
from=20
1). The next n lines should contain the field with the "." characters =
replaced=20
by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty =
line=20
between field outputs.=20
