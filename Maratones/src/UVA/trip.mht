<H2>Problem A: The Trip</H2>A number of students are members of a club =
that=20
travels annually to exotic locations. Their destinations in the past =
have=20
included Indianapolis, Phoenix, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Jose, and =
Atlanta.=20
This spring they are planning a trip to Eindhoven.=20
<P>The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not=20
practical to have them share every expense as it occurs. So individuals =
in the=20
group pay for particular things, like meals, hotels, taxi rides, plane =
tickets,=20
etc. After the trip, each student's expenses are tallied and money is =
exchanged=20
so that the net cost to each is the same, to within one cent. In the =
past, this=20
money exchange has been tedious and time consuming. Your job is to =
compute, from=20
a list of expenses, the minimum amount of money that must change hands =
in order=20
to equalize (within a cent) all the students' costs.=20
<H3>The Input</H3>Standard input will contain the information for =
several trips.=20
The information for each trip consists of a line containing a positive =
integer,=20
n, the number of students on the trip, followed by n lines of input, =
each=20
containing the amount, in dollars and cents, spent by a student. There =
are no=20
more than 1000 students and no student spent more than $10,000.00. A =
single line=20
containing 0 follows the information for the last trip.=20
<H3>The Output</H3>For each trip, output a line stating the total amount =
of=20
money, in dollars and cents, that must be exchanged to equalize the =
students'=20
costs.=20
