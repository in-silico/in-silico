<H2><A name="SECTION1"><FONT color="#0070e8">Background</FONT></A></H2>

<P>In a certain democracy, the party in the government is reorganizing the electoral 
districts in order to benefit them in the next election.</P>

<P>One delegate is elected for each district. And, as the regime is <EM>de facto</EM> a 
two-party system, they just need one more vote than the opposition for each district.</P>

<H2><A name="SECTION1"><FONT color="#0070e8">The Problem</FONT></A></H2>

<P>The country is divided into a square mesh of NxN zones; these zones are grouped into 
electoral districts. There are N districts, and each district is composed by N zones. The 
zones of a district are adjacent, that is, we can reach all the zones of a same district 
by moving to the left, right, up or down.</P>

<P>Suppose the party in the government is A, and the party in the opposition is B. From 
previous elections, we know the number of votes for each party in each zone. Two NxN 
matrices are available, one with the number of votes for party A, and another one for the 
votes for party B.</P>

<P>For each district, we take the sum of the votes of its zones. Then, the party with more 
total votes in that district gains a delegate. If the number of votes is equal for A and 
B, then no delegate is assigned.</P>

<P>Party A has hired you to compute the largest possible difference they can obtain --in 
number of delegates-- with an adequate arrangement of the districts.</P>

<H2 class="western"><A name="SECTION0001003000000000000000"></A><FONT color="#0070e8">The 
Input</FONT></H2>

<P>The input begins with a line where the number of test cases (T) is indicated. The data 
for each test case appear in successive lines. For each test case, the first line contains 
the dimension of the country (N, with maximum value 5, and the country has N by N zones). 
Following, there are 2N lines, each line with N integers between 1 and 1000, separated by 
a space. The first N lines contain the votes for party A, and the other N lines the votes 
for party B.</P>

<H2 class="western"><A name="SECTION0001004000000000000000"></A><FONT color="#0070e8">The 
Output</FONT></H2>

<P>The output consists of T lines, one for each test case. <SPAN style="font-style: normal">For each case, the maximum achievable difference between the 
number of delegates obtained by party A with respect to party B is represented.</SPAN></P>
