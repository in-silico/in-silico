<P>It is a well known fact that some people do not have their social abilities 
completely enabled. One example is the lack of talent for calculating distances 
and intervals of time. This causes some people to always choose the longest way 
to go from one place to another, with the consequence that they are late to 
whatever appointments they have, including weddings and programming contests. 
This can be highly annoying for their friends. 
<P>César has this kind of problem. When he has to go from one point to another 
he realizes that he has to visit many people, and thus always chooses the 
longest path. One of César's friends, Felipe, has understood the nature of the 
problem. Felipe thinks that with the help of a computer he might be able to 
calculate the time that César is going to need to arrive to his destination. 
That way he could spend his time in something more enjoyable than waiting for 
César. 
<P>
<P><BR>Your goal is to help Felipe developing a program that computes the length 
of the longest path that can be constructed in a given graph from a given 
starting point (César's residence). You can assume that the graph has no cycles 
(there is no path from any node to itself), so César will reach his destination 
in a finite time. In the same line of reasoning, nodes are not considered 
directly connected to themselves. 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A 
name=SECTION0001001000000000000000>Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>The input 
consists of a number of cases. The first line on each case contains a positive 
number <I>n</I> ( <!-- MATH: $1 < n \le 100$ --><IMG border=0 
alt="$1 < n \le 100$" align=middle src="longest_files/10000img1.gif" width=96 
height=30>) that specifies the number of points that César might visit (i.e., 
the number of nodes in the graph). 
<P>A value of <I>n</I> = 0 indicates the end of the input. 
<P>
<P><BR>After this, a second number <I>s</I> is provided, indicating the starting 
point in César's journey ( <!-- MATH: $1 \le s \le n$ --><IMG border=0 
alt="$1 \le s \le n$" align=middle src="longest_files/10000img2.gif" width=78 
height=30>). Then, you are given a list of pairs of places <I>p</I> and 
<I>q</I>, one pair per line, with the places on each line separated by 
white-space. The pair ``<IMG border=0 alt="$p \ q$" align=middle 
src="longest_files/10000img3.gif" width=27 height=30>" indicates that César can 
visit <I>q</I> after <I>p</I>. 
<P>A pair of zeros (``<TT>0 0</TT>") indicates the end of the case. 
<P>
<P><BR>As mentioned before, you can assume that the graphs provided will not be 
cyclic. 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A 
name=SECTION0001002000000000000000>Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>For each test 
case you have to find the length of the longest path that begins at the starting 
place. You also have to print the number of the final place of such longest 
path. If there are several paths of maximum length, print the final place with 
smallest number. 
<P>
<P><BR>Print a new line after each test case.
