<H2>Problem G: Interpreter</H2></CENTER><BR>A certain computer has 10 =
registers=20
and 1000 words of RAM. Each register or RAM location holds a 3-digit =
integer=20
between 0 and 999. Instructions are encoded as 3-digit integers and =
stored in=20
RAM. The encodings are as follows:=20
<UL>
  <LI>100 means <I>halt</I>=20
  <LI>2dn means <I>set register d to n (between 0 and 9)</I>=20
  <LI>3dn means <I>add n to register d</I>=20
  <LI>4dn means <I>multiply register d by n</I>=20
  <LI>5ds means <I>set register d to the value of register s</I>=20
  <LI>6ds means <I>add the value of register s to register d</I>=20
  <LI>7ds means <I>multiply register d by the value of register s</I>=20
  <LI>8da means <I>set register d to the value in RAM whose address is =
in=20
  register a</I>=20
  <LI>9sa means <I>set the value in RAM whose address is in register a =
to the=20
  value of register s</I>=20
  <LI>0ds means <I>goto the location in register d unless register s =
contains=20
  0</I> </LI></UL>
<P>All registers initially contain 000. The initial content of the RAM =
is read=20
from standard input. The first instruction to be executed is at RAM =
address 0.=20
All results are reduced modulo 1000.=20
<H3>Input</H3>
<P><B>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by =
itself=20
indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described =
below.=20
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line =
between=20
two consecutive inputs. </B>
<P>
<P>The input to your program consists of up to 1000 3-digit unsigned =
integers,=20
representing the contents of consecutive RAM locations starting at 0.=20
Unspecified RAM locations are initialized to 000.=20
<H3>Output</H3>
<P><B>For each test case, the output must follow the description below. =
The=20
outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line. </B>
<P>
<P>The output from your program is a single integer: the number of =
instructions=20
executed up to and including the <I>halt</I> instruction. You may assume =
that=20
the program does halt.=20
