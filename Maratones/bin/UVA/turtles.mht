<H2>Problem F: Weights and Measures</H2><EM>I know, up on top you are =
seeing=20
great sights, <BR>But down at the bottom, we, too, should have rights. =
<BR>We=20
turtles can't stand it. Our shells will all crack! <BR>Besides, we need =
food. We=20
are starving!" groaned Mack. </EM>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>Mack, in an effort to avoid being cracked, has enlisted your advice =
as to the=20
order in which turtles should be dispatched to form Yertle's throne. =
Each of the=20
five thousand, six hundred and seven turtles ordered by Yertle has a =
different=20
weight and strength. Your task is to build the largest stack of turtles=20
possible. </P>
<P>Standard input consists of several lines, each containing a pair of =
integers=20
separated by one or more space characters, specifying the weight and =
strength of=20
a turtle. The weight of the turtle is in grams. The strength, also in =
grams, is=20
the turtle's overall carrying capacity, including its own weight. That =
is, a=20
turtle weighing 300g with a strength of 1000g could carry 700g of =
turtles on its=20
back. There are at most 5,607 turtles. </P>
<P>Your output is a single integer indicating the maximum number of =
turtles that=20
can be stacked without exceeding the strength of any one. </P>
