Inc. is a=20
joint stock company, that is, a company in which every stockholder =
legally owns=20
shares of stock that account for some percentage of the total shares of =
stock of=20
the company. Due to the global economic crisis, the management rules of =
Envy=20
Inc. define a particular way for distributing last year's profit: if a=20
stockholder owns more than half of the shares of stock, he/she wins the =
total=20
profit. Nothing fancy so far in this wild world!=20
<P>Nevertheless, there are situations in which no stockholder owns more =
than 50%=20
of the shares of stock of the company. So, in order to gain some profit, =

stockholders are allowed to form <EM>coalitions</EM>, i.e., groups of=20
stockholders. The participation of the coalition, share-wise, is =
equivalent to=20
the sum of its stockholders' percentile participation. Hence, if a =
coalition has=20
more than half of the shares of stock, its members win the totality of =
last=20
years profit. Then, the members of the coalition receive a part of the =
profit=20
proportional to their individual participation in the coalition.=20
<P>For instance, let us assume there are 5 stockholders: <SPAN=20
class=3DMATH><I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN=20
class=3DMATH><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>D</I></SPAN> and =
<SPAN=20
class=3DMATH><I>E</I></SPAN>, owning <SPAN class=3DMATH>20%</SPAN>, =
<SPAN=20
class=3DMATH>12%</SPAN>, <SPAN class=3DMATH>14%</SPAN>, <SPAN =
class=3DMATH>29%</SPAN>=20
and <SPAN class=3DMATH>25%</SPAN> of the stock of the company, =
respectively. The=20
stockholder <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>E</I></SPAN> could form several =
winning=20
coalitions. For example, if <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>E</I></SPAN> were to =
form a=20
coalition with <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN=20
class=3DMATH><I>B</I></SPAN>, he/she would get <SPAN =
class=3DMATH>43.86%</SPAN> of=20
last year's profit. If <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>E</I></SPAN> were to form a =
coalition=20
with <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>B</I></SPAN> and <SPAN =
class=3DMATH><I>C</I></SPAN>=20
instead, he/she would get <SPAN class=3DMATH>49.02%</SPAN> of last =
year's profit.=20
On the other hand, <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>E</I></SPAN> could not form a =
winning=20
coalition with only <SPAN class=3DMATH><I>A</I></SPAN>.=20
<P>Your problem is, given a distribution of shares of stock of Envy =
Inc., and a=20
stockholder, to determine the maximum percentage of the last year's =
profit that=20
the given stockholder may win.=20

<P>The input consists of several test cases, each one defining a =
